### Description

Borgbackup Server Container is a fork of the original work from https://github.com/grantbevis/borg-server‚Å†

In this fork, I have updated all the packages to the latest version (at the time of writing) for the best of security and functionality.

### Usage
```
services:
  borg-server:
    restart: always
    image: workleast/borg-server
    container_name: borg-server
    volumes:
      - path/to/repository:/backups
      - ./ssh/authorized_keys:/home/borg/.ssh/authorized_keys
    ports:
      - "2022:22"
    environment:
      TZ: "Asia/Ho_Chi_Minh"
```

#### Note
- Change the 'path/to/repository' in file 'docker-compose.yml' to the actual path of your Borg's repository
- Place your ssh's public keys in file 'ssh/authorized_keys'
- On the Borg's client, connect to the server using user 'borg' (eg. ssh://borg@your-server-ip:2022/backups)
